This is my SandBox for playing around with ASP.NET Core.

## Feature Folders
A neat way of organising files by feature rather than file type. 

Each feature folder contains related Controller classes, model classes, views, and content. When develping a feature, everything is in one place, and there's no need to continually navigate between the Controller, Views, and Models folders. I can see this catching on.

Here's a good blog post describing how to enable feature folders in ASP.NET Core MVC -
