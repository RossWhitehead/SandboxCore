# SandboxCore
This is my SandBox for playing around with ASP.NET Core.

Here's what I've implemented so far..

## Feature Folders
A neat way of organising files by feature rather than file type. 

Each feature folder contains related Controller classes, model classes, views, and content. When develping a feature, everything is in one place, and there's no need to continually navigate between the Controller, Views, and Models folders. I can see this catching on.

Here's a good blog post describing how to enable feature folders in ASP.NET Core MVC -

## CQRS
I've been playing around with CQRS. It's a pattern that I've only used once in a commercial application, and that implementation was quite basic. So I'm trying out a few variations on how to implement CQRS.

### Basic CQRS with based on MS patterns and practices

### CQRS with MediatR

### Ubiquitous CQRS with CommandDispatcher and QueryDispatcher
